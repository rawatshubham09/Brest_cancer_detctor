This Machine Learning model predict - class 2 or class 4 level of breast cancer.
I collected data from UCI Machine Learning Repository link :- https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Balloons
On calculating Accuracy of various Algo, I find best model to be SVC model with Accuracy of 97.6%
SVC => acc = 97.6 std = 2.21%
Random Forest => acc = 96.71% std = 2.27%
